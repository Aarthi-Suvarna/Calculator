# Calculator
This Python calculator program consists of a main calculator loop that continuously presents a user menu offering four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with an option to quit. Inside the loop, the user is prompted to input their choice. If they select a mathematical operation, the program requests two numeric inputs, performs the chosen operation using dedicated functions, and displays the result. If the user inputs "quit," the program terminates. Invalid inputs are handled with an error message, allowing the user to retry. This code provides a fundamental command-line calculator, serving as a foundation for further enhancements or the creation of a more user-friendly graphical interface.
